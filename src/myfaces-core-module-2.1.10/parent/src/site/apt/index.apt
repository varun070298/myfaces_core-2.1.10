MyFaces Core 2.1 Project

  This project provides an implementation of the JavaServer Faces 2.1 (JSF 2.1) specification.

    * The API submodule implements all of the classes that are defined in the specification. 
      If you are looking for API documentation about the classes that your JSF application
      needs to use, then see the javadoc for the API module.

    * The Impl submodule provides "invisible" support classes that user code does not directly
      invoke, but which is needed for a working JSF framework. Examples are the renderer classes
      for the standard JSF components.

  These two libraries (myfaces-api.jar and myfaces-impl.jar) are deployed together with your
  code to form a JSF web application.
  
  Additionally, there are other submodules:  
      
    * The Shared internal submodule provides support "invisible" classes "shared" between other 
      projects in MyFaces land like Tomahawk, Orchestra and Portlet Bridge. A copy of these 
      classes are added to Impl submodule.
      
    * The Bundle submodule provides both API and Impl classes into a single jar file with 
      a OSGi MANIFEST.MF.

  If you want to know more about how JavaServer(tm) Faces works, take a look at the documentation
  referenced from the main MyFaces site.

Requirements

  JSF 2.1 requires java 1.5 or later, JSP 2.1, JSTL 1.2 and a Java Servlet 2.5 implementation.
