 * Using this annotation allows to use a custom faces-config.xml for the test class.
 * The values here are relative to the web context path, defined by 
 * AbstractMyFacesTestCase.getWebappContextFilePath() and
 * AbstractMyFacesTestCase.getWebappContextURI(), so it can be seen as an alias for
 * javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES web config param, just to make easier work with different
 * config files.
